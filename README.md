soot-infoflow-summaries
=======================

This repository contains the source code and artifacts for StubDroid, an approach for automatically
inferencing library summaries from the Android SDK or Java JDK. The implementation is intended to be
run with the FlowDroid data flow tracker which is also available [here on Github](https://github.com/secure-software-engineering/soot-infoflow)

Pre-generated summaries for the Android SDK are available in the "androidSummaries" folder. The ones
for the Oracle SDK are in the "jdkSummaries" folder.

If you have any questions concerning StubDroid, please feel free to contact Steven Arzt at

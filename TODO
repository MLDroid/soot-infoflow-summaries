TODOs:
	- Null parameter sources:
		e.g we have:
		Object m(LinkedList l1){
			return l1.get(0)
		}
		In the dummy main method we create an instance of LinkedList. However the fields
		l1.first and l2.next are still null. When we now check for
		
		l2 = l1.first
		.....
		l2' = l2
		....
		l3 = l2'.item 
		
		we don't identify l2'.item because l2' does not point to l2 (null points to nothing)
		
		Possible solutions:
			- run infoflow with l1* and do the identification of sources with an apl > 1 in a post processing step.
			
	- False positives
		if we have different flows through a method which have the same taint infoflow merges the flows. Later infoflow is not able 
		to reconstruct both path correctly again. 
		(infoflow bug)
	
	- for class linkedlist we get as sources for linkedlist.get()
		- node.item
		- node.next.item
		- node.next.next.item
		...
		up to our apl
		
	- backwards reconstruction of local.field is incomplete for some cases
		- e.g. if we have a method with a flow from this.f1 -> this.f1' 
		m() {
			this = @this
			l0' = this.f1'
			l1' = l0'.f2'
			l0 = this.f1
			l1 = l0.f2
			
		}
